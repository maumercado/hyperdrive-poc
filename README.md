This project has a Fastify API that allows a user to upload files to a Hyperdrive, and view the files that have been uploaded. Later, the user can share the key generated by Hyperdrive so that it can be mirrored or downloaded through the [`drives` cli](https://github.com/holepunchto/drives) created by holepunch.
